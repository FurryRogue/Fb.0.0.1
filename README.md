F♭ V.0.0.1
==========

## A programming language aimed at music composition.

This directory is an implementation of the programming language F♭.
A music-composition DSL, designed and implemented during the final
mini-project at a course named `Programming Language Design`,
at DIKU in 2016.

## Trying out the language.

 1. Check that your machine has a group for playing audio, and add yourself to it.
    > `hello, 1 2,`
    > `testing blockquote`
 2. Install a music-synthesis or sequencer program. (I suggest fluidsynth).
    > `sudo apt-get install fluidsynth`
    > `sudo apt-get install fluid-soundfont-gm`
    > `sudo apt-get install jackd2`
    > `sudo apt-get install alsa`
